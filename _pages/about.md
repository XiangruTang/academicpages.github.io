I am now working at Tencent AI LAB and also a member of Laboratory of [Network Data Science & Technology](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/lab/lab/english) in [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences) (UCAS), advised by [Yanyan Lan](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~lanyanyan/) fortunately. I enjoyed my fantastic research internships and undergrad years at HUST, PKU, UCAS, and UC Berkeley BAIR. 

My research interest lies in various NLP problems in language understanding, generation, and grounding that require effective understanding of contexts.

# Research Interest

Previously, I was working on text generation, question answering, and interpretability within machine learning.

For now, I'm interested in how machine could tackle **cognitive ability** (such as reasoning, planning, imagination) and how that can help a learner figure out high-level representations on both the perception and action sides.

>Cognitive ability is defined as a general mental capability involving reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, complex idea comprehension, and learning from experience (Gottfredson, 1997).

I am developing machine learning tools and techniques of everyday cognitive abilities, focusing on problems that are easier for people than they are for machines. The human mind is the best-known solution to a diverse array of challenging computational problems: learning new concepts, learning new tasks, understanding scenes, learning a language, asking questions, forming explanations, amongst many others. Machines also struggle to simulate other facets of human intelligence, including creativity, curiosity, self-assessment, and commonsense reasoning. And I know it is my great happiness to contribute towards it and finding answers to the following question.

* What are general mathematical models of perceiving, reasoning and learning?
* How does intelligence emerge from a complicated structure?
* What should the new paradigm of scientific research be in this AI era?
* How do agents interact and cooperate to build things, interweave concepts and discover knowledge?
