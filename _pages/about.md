I’m a graduate student at Yale University, advised by [Dragomir Radev](https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/dragomir-radev).

My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence, and especially various problems in *****language generation and grounding** that require effective understanding of contexts. More specifically, I am currently interested in building conversational natural language interfaces (NLIs) that can help humans explore and reason over data in any agents (e.g., relational databases and robots) in a robust and trusted manner. It involves studies in semantic parsing, dialogue systems, text summarization, and robotics. 

 <!--and also a member of [Institute of Computing Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/) in [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences) (UCAS). advised by [Yanyan Lan](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~lanyanyan/) fortunately.--> 
 
I have been working at **Dr. Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures**. We teamed up 11 award-winning authors with my model to write science fiction, support creativity, and empower humans, which was reported by People’s Daily, Yahoo news, etc. Previously, I did research on efficient pretraining with the Machine Learning group at Microsoft Research Asia, advised by Guolin Ke; and retrieval-augmented generation at Tencent AI Lab, advised by Yan Wang. I was a guest student at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, advised by Yanyan Lan, my project on detecting COVID-19-related fake news in social media was awarded by our government and deployed into real practice to curb the pandemic.

I used to be involved with the hackathon community. I was a member of Unique-Studio, we found the earliest and largest collegiate hackathon in China. And I was a mentor in the world’s largest collegiate hackathon, CalHacks at UC Berkeley.

"There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living." -- Nelson Mandela. I'm now a board member of the Chinese Entrepreneurs Organization (CEO). I believe innovation is the key to entrepreneurship, while leadership affects the effectiveness and accuracy of innovation. 

If you're interested in my research or CEO, please feel free to contact me: xiangru.tang@yale.edu.

# Honor

* I won the **first place** in the final roadshow of 6-th National Youth AI Innovation and Entrepreneurship Conference, organized by Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence. This project is about providing AI functionality as a Service in enterprise contexts.


* Our team  won the **first place** in the Deecamp 2020, Sinovation Ventures and was lectured by 12 world-renowned AI experts including Andrew NG, Zhihua ZHOU and Kai-fu LEE. 

* I won the **first place** in the 2020 Artificial Intelligence Application Innovation Competition, HUAWEI CLOUD. This project is about AI-based information management transformation and enterprise office services.

* National Scholarship, Ministry of Education.

* MOE-Google Collaboration Fellowship, Ministry of Education and Google LLC.

# Research Interest

I have been working on text generation. I'm developing machine learning tools and techniques of everyday cognitive abilities, focusing on problems that are easier for people than they are for machines. The human mind is the best-known solution to a diverse array of challenging computational problems: learning new concepts, learning new tasks, understanding scenes, learning a language, asking questions, forming explanations, amongst many others. Machines also struggle to simulate other facets of human intelligence, including creativity, curiosity, self-assessment, and commonsense reasoning. And I know it is my great happiness to contribute towards it and finding answers to the following question.

* What are general mathematical models of perceiving, reasoning and learning?
* How does intelligence emerge from a complicated structure?
* What should the new paradigm of scientific research be in this AI era?
* How do agents interact and cooperate to build things, interweave concepts and discover knowledge?
