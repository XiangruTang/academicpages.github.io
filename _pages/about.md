I am now working at <!--[ML Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) of -->Microsoft Research. I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ming Zhou (ACL president)](https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=a0w5c0gAAAAJ&hl=en), [Prof. Dragomir R. Radev (ACM/AAAI Fellow)](https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/dragomir-radev) and [Prof. Yanyan Lan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mNfCP3gAAAAJ&hl=en). My research interest lies in various NLP problems in language generation and grounding that require effective understanding of contexts. Also, I am interested in computational social science, such as (NLP for) sociology of learning and sociology of knowledge.


 <!--and also a member of [Institute of Computing Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/) in [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences) (UCAS). advised by [Yanyan Lan](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~lanyanyan/) fortunately.--> I enjoyed my research internships and fantastic undergrad years at:

* Unique-Studio: We found the earliest and largest collegiate hackathon in China.
* Chinese Academy of Sciences: Detecting COVID-19-related fake news in social media was awarded by our government and deployed into real practice to pandemic.

* Sinovation Ventures: We teamed up 11 award-winning authors with my model to write science fiction, support creativity, and empower humans, which was reported by People's Daily, Yahoo news, etc. 
 
* Tencent, Microsoft Research and UC Berkeley...

# Research Interest

Previously, I was working on text generation, question answering, and interpretability within machine learning.

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gGcRkpYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) 

I am developing machine learning tools and techniques of everyday cognitive abilities, focusing on problems that are easier for people than they are for machines. The human mind is the best-known solution to a diverse array of challenging computational problems: learning new concepts, learning new tasks, understanding scenes, learning a language, asking questions, forming explanations, amongst many others. Machines also struggle to simulate other facets of human intelligence, including creativity, curiosity, self-assessment, and commonsense reasoning. And I know it is my great happiness to contribute towards it and finding answers to the following question.

* What are general mathematical models of perceiving, reasoning and learning?
* How does intelligence emerge from a complicated structure?
* What should the new paradigm of scientific research be in this AI era?
* How do agents interact and cooperate to build things, interweave concepts and discover knowledge?

# Education
* University of Chinese Academy of Science, Master of Computer Science, Beijing, China 
* UC Berkeley, Department of EECS and Berkeley AI Research Lab(BAIR), GPA:3.8/4. Berkeley, CA, USA.
