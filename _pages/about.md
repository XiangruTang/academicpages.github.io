I am an incoming MSc student at Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ICT-CAS), fortunately advised by [Yanyan Lan](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~lanyanyan/). Before joining ICT-CAS, I enjoyed four fantasic undergrad years and three research internships at CCNU, HUST, PKU, ICT-CAS and UC Berkeley. My ultimate goal is to understand human intelligence, specifically, I am currently interested in grounded language learning.

<font color="#dd0000">I am continually applying for internships or Ph.D positions.</font><br /> 

I am also an amateur Go player and accordionist, I started to learn how to play them when I was 6. I am actively looking for potential collaborations (both hobby-wise or research-wise!), feel free to contact me for some potential projects or some fun!

## Research Interest

Previously, I was working on dialogue generation, question answering and interpretability. 

For now, my research aims at grounded language learning, especially how networks tackle cognitive tasks, such as reasoning, planning, imagination and how that can help a learner figure out high-level representations on both the perception and action sides.
