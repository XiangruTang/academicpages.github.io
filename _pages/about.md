I’m a graduate student at Yale University, advised by [Dragomir Radev](https://cpsc.yale.edu/people/dragomir-radev). I'm a member of [LILY (Yale NLP)](https://yale-lily.github.io/) lab. I work in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computational Biology and Drug Discovery. 

My research interest lies in various problems in language generation and grounding that require an effective understanding of contexts. And proteins, which can be represented as strings of amino-acid letters, are a natural fit to many NLP methods. 

# Work Experience

I worked at [Dr. Kai-Fu Lee's Sinovation Ventures](https://www.sinovationventures.com/) and we teamed up 11 award-winning authors with my model to write science fiction, support creativity, and empower humans, which was reported by People’s Daily, Yahoo news, etc. Previously, I did research on efficient pretraining with the Machine Learning group at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/), advised by Guolin Ke; and retrieval-augmented generation at [Tencent AI Lab](https://ai.tencent.com/ailab/en/index), advised by Yan Wang. I was a guest student at [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/about_us/), advised by Yanyan Lan, my project on detecting COVID-19-related fake news in social media was awarded by our government and deployed into real practice to curb the pandemic.

I used to be involved with the hackathon community. I was a member of Unique-Studio, we found the earliest and largest collegiate hackathon in China. And I was a mentor in the world’s largest collegiate hackathon, CalHacks at UC Berkeley.

"There is no passion to be found playing small - in settling for a life that is less than the one you are capable of living." -- Nelson Mandela. I found the Chinese Entrepreneurs Organization at Yale University. I believe innovation is the key to entrepreneurship, while leadership affects the effectiveness and accuracy of innovation.

# Research Interest

I have been working on text generation, where a model generates realistic-looking text (e.g. article writing, data-to-text, summarization, abd chatbots). In my work, with robust and efficient pretrained language models, generated texts can be controlled to match user-defined styles, task-specific behaviour and other attributes.
 
Language generation models can also be applied to synthetic protein design, which allows it to generate with fine-grained control by metrics based on primary sequence similarity, secondary structure accuracy, and conformational energy.

And I know it is my great happiness to contribute towards it and finding answers to the following question:

* How can AI offer a high level of precision to the complicated and time-consuming discovery phase in drug development, which leads to faster development timelines and a lower failure risk down the road? 

* AI also gives researchers the power to analyze disparate datasets. For example, it can combine vast libraries of chemical compounds, biomedical data from the literature, and patient health data into knowledge graphs. This data model creates new connections and insights into previously unrelated information, 

* How to analyze disparate datasets from the literature, patient health data and knowledge graphs? And how to can use them to make predictions, model novel pathways and disease states, and test findings? 

* As people pay more attention to health and even use wearable devices for monitoring, more engagement in health management and personal health data will mean more valuable data for life sciences. How to access data in a safe way?
 

I use computational and AI methods to tackle the unsolved problems in biology and healthcare, especially in the following areas: genomics, immunology, microbiome, protein folding, and molecular dynamics simulation.

Good research builds useful tools or enlightens people about the unknown. I will build tools to process and model biological data; design models to tackle real-life healthcare problems; explore the uncharted area of life science with curiosity. I believe that AI will speed up new drug discovery and realize personalized healthcare.
