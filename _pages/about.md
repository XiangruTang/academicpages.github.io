I am a senior student (now in Berkeley) and also an incoming graduate student at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/au/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Chinese_Academy_of_Sciences) (ICT-CAS), and a member of Key Laboratory of [Network Data Science & Technology](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/lab/lab/english), advised by [Yanyan Lan](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/~lanyanyan/) fortunately. Before joining ICT-CAS, I enjoyed my fantastic research internships and undergrad years at CCNU, HUST, PKU, ICT-CAS, and UC Berkeley. 

Through my research, I hope to contribute to the understanding of how intelligent systems form representations of meaning within the context of multisensory perception and communication. Specifically, I am currently interested in integrating cognitive abilities for reading, learning, reasoning, and grounding. As a quote by Albert Einstein goes: \"Any fool can know. The point is to understand.\" I am also very interested in AI for social good, in particular in healthcare and the environment (with a focus on climate change).

# Research Interest

Previously, I was working on dialogue generation, question answering, and interpretability within machine learning.

For now, my research aims at bridging machine learning and cognitive science, especially how networks could tackle **cognitive ability** (such as reasoning, planning, imagination) and how that can help a learner figure out high-level representations on both the perception and action sides.

>Cognitive ability is defined as a general mental capability involving reasoning, problem-solving, planning, abstract thinking, complex idea comprehension, and learning from experience (Gottfredson, 1997).

I am developing machine learning tools and techniques of everyday cognitive abilities, focusing on problems that are easier for people than they are for machines. The human mind is the best-known solution to a diverse array of challenging computational problems: learning new concepts, learning new tasks, understanding scenes, learning a language, asking questions, forming explanations, amongst many others. Machines also struggle to simulate other facets of human intelligence, including creativity, curiosity, self-assessment, and commonsense reasoning. And I know it is my great happiness to contribute towards it and finding answers to the following question.

* What are general mathematical models of perceiving, reasoning and learning?
* How does intelligence emerge from a complicated structure?
* What should the new paradigm of scientific research be in this AI era?
* How do agents interact and cooperate to build things, interweave concepts and discover knowledge?

# Miscellaneous

I am also an amateur Go player and accordionist, and I started to learn how to play them when I was 6. I am actively looking for potential collaborations (both hobby-wise or research-wise), feel free to contact me for some potential projects or some fun!
