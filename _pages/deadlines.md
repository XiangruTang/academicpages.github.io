>Procrastination means people do not set deadlines to bind themselves optimally. Such imperfect sophistication (or partial naivete) reflects biased self-perception, cognitive limitations in calibrating deadlines, or a deliberate mixed strategy of balancing flexibility and self-control. And self-imposed deadlines are not always as effective as external deadlines in boosting task performance. (Dan Ariely, 2012)
